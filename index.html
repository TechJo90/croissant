        <h2>Welcome to The Croissant Corner!</h2>
        <p>The croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry of Austrian origin, but is mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and are made of layered yeast-leavened dough.</p>
        
        <p>The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
        
        <p>Croissants have become a staple of French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.</p>
